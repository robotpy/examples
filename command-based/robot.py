    The CommandBasedRobot base class implements almost everything you need for
    a working robot program. All you need to do is set up the subsystems and
    commands. You do not need to override the "periodic" functions, as they
    will automatically call the scheduler. You may override the "init" functions
    if you want to do anything special when the mode changes.
