# Example that shows how to connect to a ROMI from RobotPy
#
# Requirements
# ------------
#
# You must have the robotpy-halsim-ws package installed. This is best done via:
#
#    # Windows
#    py -3 -m pip install robotpy[commands2,sim]
#
#    # Linux/macOS
#    pip3 install robotpy[commands2,sim]
#
# Run the program
# ---------------
#
# To run the program you will need to explicitly use the ws-client option:
#
#    # Windows
#    py -3 robotpy sim --ws-client
#
#    # Linux/macOS
#    python robotpy sim --ws-client
#
# By default the WPILib simulation GUI will be displayed. To disable the display
# you can add the --nogui option
#
