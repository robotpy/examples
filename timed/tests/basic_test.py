# This is a pytest based testing system. Anything you can do with
# pytest, you can do with this too. There are a few magic parameters
# provided as fixtures that will allow your tests to access the robot
# code and stuff
#
#    control - a pyfrc.test_support.controller.TestController object
#    robot - This is whatever is returned from the run function in robot.py
#    robot_file - The filename of robot.py
#    robot_path - The directory name that robot.py is located in

    This test checks to see if a joystick input causes a corresponding
    motor output. Obviously this is a silly example, but you can build
    upon it to make much more comprehensive (and stateful) tests.

    Keep in mind that when you set a value, the robot code does not
    see the value immediately, but only when teleopPeriodic is called,
    which is typically every 20ms
