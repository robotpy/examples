"""
    This sample program shows how to control a motor using a joystick. In the
    operator control part of the program, the joystick is read and the value
    is written to the motor.

    Joystick analog values range from -1 to 1 and speed controller inputs also
    range from -1 to 1 making it easy to work together. The program also delays
    a short time in the loop to allow other threads to run. This is generally
    a good idea, especially since the joystick values are only transmitted
    from the Driver Station once every 20ms.
